One online assessment and four interview rounds. I am from our tier three college and a 2025 graduate. I have applied directly through Amazon's career portal for SD1 role in September. [clears throat] And then on December 3rd, I got an online assessment link. So the online assessment mmedly consist of two parts. The first one is coding section and the second one is work style assessment. So in the coding section there were two DSA question and both were like medium to hard level questions. So the first question was on a binary string in which I have to obtain a lexographically maximum string by repeatedly appending characters and reversing the string. [music] So this was based on greedy approach and string manipulation. The second question was like you are given a area of workers and you have to find the number of combinations of four workers uh that follow a\"),\n",

So overall both the questions [music] checked the reasoning and logic uh more than straightforward coding. So [music] uh in the work style assessment uh it was majorly scenario based and behavioral questions. [music] So Amazon have 16 leadership principles that shows how Amazon work and make decisions. [music] So you have to go through those principle. I would apply link I would uh [clears throat] provide link in the description. [music] So like um you have to answer those question according to those early principle of Amazon [music] and like you will given a scenario and you have to choose a option like that how would you behave in that particular scenario'),\n",

So on the 16th of January uh I had in person interview in the Bangalore office. So the first round was like there were total 40 to 50 people and I was the first one who went for the first round. [music] So uh in the first round first the interviewer there were two interviewers and they started with my introduction and then they asked like what are the technologies I have [music] used and what are the difference between different technologies and in a particular scenario or application what technology will I use and why something like that.

So uh I solved that question then the interviewers asked me to uh write the time and space complexity and when they satisfied with the solution they told me to write the solution in the pen and paper. So always make sure that you write clean code and follow meaningful variable names and a readable structure. [music] So after that uh they move to the second question which was uh like uh you are given a binary tree and you have to convert it into a [music] left skewed or right skewed binary tree in a level order traverser.

After that in the last 10 minute they asked me uh some behavioral question related to uh a leadership principle which is deliver result. So they asked me like tell me about a time when you deliver results under pressure [music] something like that. So I explained I have some stories prepared for that. So I explained those stories there. [music] After that uh waiting for like half an hour I moved forward for the second round and that was also purely DSA based.

So you have to optimize that uh for the space also you have to just use only of n and [music] space. So I have done that using dynamic programming and they were satisfied with both the questions. So they moved forward for the behavioral part [music] in which they asked questions related to ownership uh which is a Amazon's leadership principle.

So I was not too much aware of it. What are they going to ask? So uh this round was uh just a discussion about how did you use GI tools in your work and what are the different tools have you explored till now [music] and how do you validate code generated by AI something like that also they asked that how do you ensure maintainability of a code so I explained like a solid principles [music] a little system design concept that to how to ensure maintainability of a code so they asked me to like uh give example of some solid principles something like that also [music] if this code uh gives error how would you handle it and different types'),\n",

So [music] uh it was a bar raiser round and the bar raiser is a person who has like 10 to 15 years of experience [music] and he ensures that whether you are better than the 50% of the employees of Amazon or not. [music] So it was completely behavioral. Uh he was a person from US. [music] So he asked me four to five questions something like tell me about a time you learned something new and [music] uh what metrics have you used to uh know that there's a change needed in your program something like that [music] so I mapped every question to\"),\n",

So you can also do the same. And this round was around like 30 to 35 minutes. [music] And uh the problem was uh I struggled a little to understand [music] his accent as he was speaking quite fast. So I asked him to repeat some couple of questions and speak a little slowly. So maybe he considered it as a negative point [music] as I was unable to understand the accent clearly. So on 13th January I got an email that [music] I'm not moving forward uh with Amazon. But it was a great experience. [music] So I would suggest that don't take the behavioral round lightly.

If you don't have experience so from your personal project or your academic projects which [music] uh in which was in a team and be consistent with DSA follow a particular sheet I have followed Styver's A to [music] Z sheet you can also follow the same and uh whatever you have mentioned in your resumeum have good understanding of that also computer fundamentals you can get a good resources free resources online for computer fundamentals also and nowadays they ask LLD to even the freshers. So [music] just have good understanding of LLD how to design LD for a particular problem. [music] So that's all from my side.

So they asked me like tell me about a time when you deliver results under pressure [music] something like that. So I explained I have some stories prepared for that.

So overall both the questions [music] checked the reasoning and logic uh more than straightforward coding.

[music] So you have to go through those principle. I would apply link I would uh [clears throat] provide link in the description.
